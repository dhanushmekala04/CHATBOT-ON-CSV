CSV CHATBOT FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVE
Overview
The CSV Chatbot is an interactive conversational AI system that allows users to query and explore data stored in a CSV file using natural language. By leveraging advanced language models and various libraries, the chatbot interprets user queries, retrieves relevant information, and provides insights in a conversational manner. This project aims to simplify data interaction, making it accessible for users who may not be familiar with programming or data analysis techniques.

Key Components of the Code
1. Environment Setup
The project begins by installing the necessary libraries and frameworks required for building the chatbot. These include:

LangChain: Provides conversational AI capabilities.
Sentence Transformers: Used for creating embeddings.
FAISS: Enables efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
Hugging Face Transformers: Provides access to pre-trained large language models.
2. Hugging Face Login
Users log into the Hugging Face Hub to access pre-trained models and datasets, facilitating easier model management and integration.

3. Importing Required Libraries
The code imports various libraries needed for model integration, document loading, text processing, and conversational chains, ensuring the chatbot functions seamlessly.

4. Model Loading and Configuration
The Mistral-7B model is loaded with quantization settings to reduce memory usage, enabling it to run efficiently even on resource-constrained hardware.
The model is configured for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which minimizes the number of trainable parameters, speeding up training while maintaining high performance.
5. Text Generation Pipeline
A text generation pipeline is established using the model and tokenizer, allowing for quick experimentation with text generation tasks without needing detailed configuration.

6. Data Loading and Processing
The CSV file is loaded using the CSVLoader from LangChain. The data is then split into smaller chunks using the CharacterTextSplitter, which is essential for efficiently managing large datasets.

7. Embedding and Vector Store Integration
FAISS is utilized to store document embeddings, enabling fast retrieval based on semantic similarity. The embeddings effectively capture the semantic meaning of the data, facilitating effective querying.

8. Conversational Retrieval Chain
A ConversationalRetrievalChain is created, combining the language model with the retriever to maintain context during conversations. This chain allows the chatbot to respond dynamically to queries based on prior interactions.

9. Interactive Query System
An interactive loop prompts the user for queries related to the CSV data. The chatbot retrieves answers using the defined conversational chain and maintains a history of interactions for contextual understanding.

Example Queries
Users can input various questions related to the CSV data, such as:

"Which country has the highest greenhouse gas emissions?"
"What is the average sales amount for each product?"
